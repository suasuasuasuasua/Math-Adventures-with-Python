# notes for drawing polygons

## functions to draw polygons

- Processing has functions to draw any polygon we want
  - beginShape() begins the shape
  - vertex(xcor,ycor) lets you specify as many vertices as you want
  - endShape(CLOSE) closes the shape and connects the first/last vertices
- in this way, we can create any polygon by using trigonometric logic
