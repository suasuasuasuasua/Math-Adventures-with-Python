# notes on complex numbers

## introduction
- complex numbers are extremely real!
- complex numbers are extensively used in electromagnetism and other applications
- a complex number is defined in this form:
  - a + bi, where a and b are both real numbers; i is the square root of -1
  - therefore, complex numbers have two parts to worry about
- in Python, one-dimensional objects suddenly become two-dimensional objects

## plotting
- complex number addition works analogously to vector addition
  - simply add the respective components
- we can think (x,y) as z = x + iy, where z is the complex number
- we can imagine the x-axis as the real number line, and the y-axis as the imaginary number line
