## finding an equilateral triangle

- the triangle() function draws a triangle, but takes in 6 arguments
  - (xcor1, ycor1, xcor2, ycor2, xcor3, ycor3), or all 3 coordinates of the vertices
- to find these coordinates, we need to know facts about the 30,60,90 triangle
  - knowing the ratios of lengths will help us determine the coordinates
